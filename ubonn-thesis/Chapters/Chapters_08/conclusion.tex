\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

This thesis describes the analysis and measurement of a rare Standard Model process, the associated production of a single top-quark and a Z boson using full Run II dataset (2015-2018) which corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. The measurement is performed in the tri-lepton channel. This channel offers maximum reach in spite of the suppressed branching ratios as the presence of the three charged leptons in the final state significantly reduces the background. A python based (tensorflow) neural network algorithm is  trained in  order to separate the signal and background distributions. A simultaneous binned maximum-likelihood fit of the signal regions and control regions  is performed and from the fit, cross-section is extracted. The extracted cross-section of tllq is $\sigma(pp\rightarrow tZq \rightarrow Wbl^{+}l^{-}q)$ = 132  $\pm$ 12  (stat) $\pm$ 17 (syst) fb with the SM prediction of 102 fb under the assumption of a top-quark mass of $m_{t}$ = 172.5 GeV.
